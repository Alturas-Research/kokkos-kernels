Compact Batched BLAS/LAPACK
===========================

1. Edit Makefile.inc. Kokkoskernels batched BLAS depends on Kokkos. At the
   minimum set KOKKOS, CXX, CXXFLAGS and LIBS variables. KOKKOS variable
   should point to the Kokkos installation directory. The other variables
   are self explanatory. For example, LIBS would be set to "-lm" in platforms
   where that is needed.

2. Do "make all" in the host/ directory.
